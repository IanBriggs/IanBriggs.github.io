Why not make my first post be a description of how I put together this website?
It will help me when I come back and wonder what I did.

My overall goals are to:
* host it on github
* don't hard code it in html/css/js
* have it look a little cool
* make a website that has my picture, info, and a blog

## Github

The github part is quite easy, I just made a repo named `ianbriggs.github.io`
  and placed an `index.html` file in it.
After making the repo all I had to do was:

{% highlight bash %}
> git clone git@github.com:IanBriggs/ianbriggs.github.io.git
> cd ianbriggs.github.io
> echo "Hello world" > index.html
> git add index.html
> git commit -m "Hello world"
...
> git push
...
{% endhighlight %}

This made the address
  [https://ianbriggs.github.io/](https://ianbriggs.github.io/) look like this:

Yay!
I have a website on github.
Let's move on to using jekyll.

## Static site generator

I am loosely following the github
  [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
  for using jekyll.
So I am making this on a Mac, which means when I try to install jekyll using
  gem it errors out due to permissions.

{% highlight bash %}
> gem install bundler jekyll
Fetching bundler-2.4.17.gem
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You donâ€™t have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0 directory.
> which gem
/usr/bin/gem
{% endhighlight %}

I could run it with `sudo`, but I have destroyed enough systems to have a
  pathological fear of the power given by that particular command.
To get around this I use [brew](https://brew.sh/) to get a non Apple ruby
  install and then refresh my zsh environment:

{% highlight bash %}
> brew install ruby
...
ruby is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have ruby first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
...
> echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
> source ~/.zshrc
> which gem
/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/gem
{% endhighlight %}

Now when I call `gem` it will give me the brewed one.
Onward to victory!

With that out off the way I can install jekyll and build an example website.

{% highlight bash %}
> gem install bundler jekyll
...
Done installing documentation for webrick, unicode-display_width, ...
29 gems installed
> jekyll new --skip-bundle .
...
> git add --all
> git rm index.html
> git commit -m "Jekyll"
...
> git push
...
{% endhighlight %}

Now github will magically build the website for me, which takes a little while.

Note: I stopped following the guide at this point and had to come back here.

The website still builds, but I would like it to use github's gems.
To do this I commented out the `gem "jekyll"` line, uncommented the line with
  `gem "github-pages"`, then added `"~> 228",`.

My shiny new statically generated website looks like this:

That is good for when I want to deploy, I can push and have the system build and
  update, but not so good for playing around.
For that I need my local machine setup to run it, first I add `webrick` since
  I'm running Ruby newer than 3.0.

{% highlight bash %}
> bundle add webrick
> bundle install
...
> bundle exec jekyll serve
...
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
{% endhighlight %}

## Themes

~~Github has a short [list](https://pages.github.com/themes/) of approved themes.
For now I will chose one and cross my fingers that it works.~~

It seems like the best thing to do is download
  [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and modify things.
I moved over `_includes`, `_layouts`, `assets`, and `_config.yml`.
To get rid of the RSS button I commented out the section of
  `_includes/footer.html`.
I'll have to come back to this later to customize the look, since CSS is not my
  strength.

## My info

Moving onto adding my information.
Changing the defaults looks to be as easy as editing `_config.yml`.
After editing I relaunch `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see the updates locally.
For some reason this is one of the few files that don't automatically get
  updated when running the server.

I don't really want a seperate "About" page, so I will remove `about.md` and
  just put that information in `index.md`.

### Notes:

* I've renamed all `*.markdown` files to `*.md`
* I place images in `assets/` then can display them in here via the markdown
  `![<description>](/assets/<image>)`. The leading slash is important.
* For more control the images can be placed using html.
