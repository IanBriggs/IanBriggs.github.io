I am a (close to graduating) computer science PhD student in the area of
  floating point mathematics and formal verification.
My mentor at the Univerity of Utah is
  [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com/).
As of 2023 I have 7 years of experience performing research, mainly focusing
  on floating point from the perspectives of error and performance.
Once floating point is chosen by a programmer they are exchanging accuracy for
  performance, but are often only given a few points in this tradeoff to chose
  from.
I want to give the programmer more choice in this tradeoff.

My current resume/CV is [here](/assets/Ian_Briggs_Resume.pdf)

While an intern at the Automated Reasoning Group I made
  [haploid](https://github.com/IanBriggs/haploid), which is a system for
  simplifying SMT queries in order to increase solver speed and stability.
